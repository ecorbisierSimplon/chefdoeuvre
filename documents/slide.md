<!--# note:
Allow me, first of all, to introduce myself – I am Eric Corbisier. My age, well, let's just say it's a number that no longer rolls off the tongue effortlessly. Over the years, I've worn various hats, starting as a postman, then navigating the realm of alarm system technical support, and eventually finding my stride as an electrical safety training instructor.

When I'm not immersed in my professional endeavors, you'll find me reveling in the joy of hands-on projects and cycling adventures. Yet, my heart belongs to the world of codes and pixels. I am fervently passionate about all things related to computer wizardry, with a particular fondness for web development. In essence – a concoction of diverse experiences, a fervent DIY enthusiast, a cycling aficionado, and an unabashed lover of the intricate dance between lines of code on the vast canvas of the web. -->
